    <p>This assignment wasn't challenging at all. This being said I had taken a class during high school on web development. We had made it all the way to where we actually looked for clients and designed websites for them. So this assignment was more of a refresher assignment. I didn't use any outside sources other than a how to take a picture using my Mac Book.</p>
